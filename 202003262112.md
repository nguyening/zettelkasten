Rilke tells Kappus to confront his sadness in Letter Eight.

- Sorrow that we ignore while among others is dangerous because it is an unlived experience. It is an unfamiliar curiosity.
- We tend to shy away from unfamiliar feelings, like most things.
- We don't know where our actions come from because we don't acknowledge our feelings when they occur.
