title: Questions are the vehicle for personal progress
---

In Letter Four, Rilke tries to provide Kappus comfort in the face of unknowns. [#rilke]

- Focus on questions/difficulty/the effort rather than answers/solutions/goals as this is how you integrate comprehension of them into *your* life.
- You cannot integrate answers given to you by other people.
- 'The Truth', or your understanding of questions/difficulties/effort comes about serendipitously, without your conscious intent.

- Consider that the act of sex or of eating, of sense and experience, are *not the end goals*. Observe how these occur in Nature, where are by reasons more nebulous than pleasure, pain, or intention.
- The 'reasons' are nebulous but we may point at concepts like creation, consumption, and beauty.
    - Rilke points at the alternating, infinite regression between creation and consumption i.e. in consuming there is an echo of creation of long ago. Along this regression Rilke says that beauty passes on from all things, unaware.
    - We might learn that 'Beauty' shall be rendered as 'Motherhood'. Do not get hung up on labels and concepts.
