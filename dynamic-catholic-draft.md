# The goal of the Church
Personal progress is the core of God's desire for the world. Helping each other become our best selves is our and the Catholic Church's goal.

# Engaged Catholics
- Engaged Catholics are those working towards the goal of the Church. We can observe them in participation within parishes.
- The Pareto (or 80/20) principle states that 80% of results come from 20% of actors.
  In financial giving and volunteering, American Catholic parishes do not follow this principle. 80% of contributions come from about 7% of registered parishioners.

# Characteristics of engaged Catholics
The broad and detailed area of *Catholicism* leads to complexity. Teaching complexity requires too much building to be practical for disengaged Catholics. These four signs are concise, characteristic attitudes and behaviors that require less. They are also general enough as a model to continue engagement.
- Though daily Mass is an accepted frequent behavior amongst engaged Catholics, it is not sufficiently accessible enough for _all_ Catholics. Only 1% of American Catholics attend Mass daily.
  The four signs are general to enable individuals to approach them idiosyncratically.
- 'Spiritual amnesia' is the tendency to forget one's own resistance or difficulty in faith to God.
    - It prevents engaged Catholics from empathizing with disengaged Catholics. It prevents 

1. Routine prayer
2. Study of faith in pursuit of accuracy
3. Generosity in relative
4. Cooperation in pursuit of the universal goal
