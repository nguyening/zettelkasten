title: TCP three-way handshake
---
Every connection begins with a handshake between client and server. The handshake exchanges two sequence numbers between the hosts.

1. The client sends a connection request to the server. This request includes a random sequence number `A`. (SYN)
2. The server acknowledges by replying with `A+1`, and including a random sequence number `B`. (SYN-ACK)
3. The client acknowledges by replying with `B+1`. (ACK)
