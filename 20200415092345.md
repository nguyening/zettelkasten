title: Good questions have valid context
---
You can dismiss a question out-of-hand based on its premises.
When these premises are not established in dialogue, it is easy to present ill-formed questions.

For example, [Effect of a single high-fat meal on endothelial function in healthy subjects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9036757) would suggest that high-fat meals impair flow in the arteries. This can be dismissed because meals provided in the study were also high-carb.
