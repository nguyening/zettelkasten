title: Effective note-taking on the web
---

Christian Tietze notes that extracting useful notes from web content is as from a book.

1. Filter information down to what seems useful.
2. Jot down and note the useful ideas and passages.
3. Ingest notes into your knowledge management process.

Personal subscriptions on any platform (Twitter, Youtube, RSS feeds) are curated, but curation does not stand in place of filtering. This is just a viewport on a part of the Internet.
Separating what is useful from the noise must be done with intent.

Skim your information feeds. Useful or interesting information must be taken out of the feed and put into an inbox to be processed later.
