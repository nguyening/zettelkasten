title: TCP fast open
---

Reducing TCP round-trips has become an important problem to tackle for Web traffic (consider that [TCP propagation delay](20200430211038.md) is limited by the speed of light).

In a normal [TCP three-way handshake](20200430201954.md) the server waits for the client's ACK to receive and process request data, which combats a class of malicious clients. *TCP fast open (TFO)* enables data transmission with the first SYN packet of the handshake. This eliminates one round-trip between request and response.

The TFO design does not detect duplicate SYN packets, so servers must tolerate duplicates, i.e. responses are idempotent.

To combat mailicious clients, TFO introduces security cookies that must be received from servers before clients can begin sending data in subsequent TCP connections.
