title: Theoretically optimal Token Bucket parameters
---

Ideally we would like to minimize packet (a) cut-off rate and (b) queueing delay, i.e. an optimal token bucket always has enough tokens to transmit the packets that arrive.

## Without queueing
Consider an optimally configured token bucket *without a queue*. This bucket has infinite capacity but has a token generation rate that varies with time.
Over a discrete time interval we consider every packet that arrives to exhaust the token bucket concurrently.

**Optimal token bucket size**
- The size, or the total tokens in the bucket, over a discrete time interval is the sum of (a) the number of tokens in the bucket at the start of the time interval, and (b) the token generation rate multiplied by the length of the time interval.
- The size of an optimal bucket >= the total bits of all packets that arrive in an interval.
- Network nodes only transmit whole packets, so an optimal bucket always has *at least* as many tokens as the largest arriving packet.
  If the bucket size is smaller than this largest packet, such packet will be dropped.
- An optimal bucket size is *at most* equal to the number of accumulated tokens between packet arrivals.

**Optimal token generation rate**
- An optimal bucket generates tokens when its size becomes less than the size of packets that arrive in a time interval.
  An infinitely high generation rate accumulates more tokens than necessary.
- For an empty bucket, the optimal generation rate is *at least* equal to the average bit transmission rate.
- The generation rate peaks in the scenario where the bucket is empty and the largest packet in the time interval arrives.
  Thus an optimal rate is *at most* equal to the maximum bit transmission rate.

## With queueing
Consider an optimal token bucket with finite capacity and a FIFO queue of finite capacity.

- A non-zero capacity FIFO queue relaxes the optimal size or generation rate by introducing a time delay when token requirements cannot be met.
  Network resources are better utilized because fewer tokens are required for immediate consumption in worst-case packet scenarios. Bursty traffic is simply queued.
