title: The effect of noise on PID control
---

The observed outputs of a system are measured by a sensor, which can be imperfect. Noise is a random disturbance on a signal, from the environment, implementation, and defects.

Derivatives are sensitive to the frequency of noise. Consider a sine wave.
Increasing the frequency of a sine wave (compressing it horizontally) will produce steeper slopes. These slopes can be adjusted by reducing the amplitude of the wave.
