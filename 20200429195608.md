title: Pre-emptive and sequential eating
---

Three square meals a day (with snacks) is a social construct. Following this schedule is to eat 'pre-emptively'.
*Pre-emptive eating* is mediated by your mind, and consequently your emotions during the peaks and valleys of the day.

*Sequential eating* is nutritional. It depends on awareness of the body's natural eating feedback signal: satiety. Satiety is signaled to the brain in two major ways:

- the hormone Leptin
- stomach receptors react to expansion in the gut.

These signals are effectively bypassed when we eat quickly.
