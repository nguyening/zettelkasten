title: Difficiencies of the Catholic Church's evangelization
---

- The broad and detailed area covered by *Catholicism* is inherently complicated.
  Immediately educating on the complexity is difficult, and people are generally apprehensive when integrating sweeping changes to their lives.
- Though daily Mass is an accepted frequent behavior amongst [engaged Catholics](20200411162458.md), it is not sufficiently accessible enough for _all_ Catholics. Only 1% of American Catholics attend Mass daily.
- 'Spiritual amnesia' is the tendency to forget one's own resistance or difficulty in faith to God. It prevents engaged Catholics from empathizing with disengaged Catholics/non-believers.
- Small, incremental changes such as spending a minute daily for a conversation with God, or reading a page of a book about Catholicism, will be the best initial steps.

- With growing resentment for Catholicism, the evangelization efforts should be directed towards inspiring change in people rather than maintaining the status quo.
- Disengaged Catholics and those who eventually leave the Church are ignorant of the arguments and perspective, not the teaching.
- The Church needs to encounter and communicate with people in a way that [resonates with them, as they are currently](20200411194922.md).
  For example the universal call to holiness, a life of character and virtue, can be reformulated as becoming the best version of ourselves with the path to 'best' modeled after Jesus.
- When considering money, the focus of the Church has been on charitable giving. This ignores the other ways it is handled: how it is earned, spent, and saved.
