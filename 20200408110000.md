title: Algorithmic approaches to QoS admission control
---

- To admit flows into a network, there are two approaches to setting up parameters for your algorithm:
    - (a) *after* understanding traffic patterns, a priori.
      It is difficult to be responsive when traffic deviates.
    - (b) *while* measuring traffic patterns.
- Real traffic measurements from (b) enable the algorithm to accurately reserve network resources, leading to better utilization.
    - With the caveat that applications can handle the network rejecting flows, i.e. some loss of data.
