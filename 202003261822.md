Kappus talks about a literary critic's introduction to a work of art in correspondence to Rilke.
In Letter Three Rilke tells Kappus to avoid static viewpoints. [#rilke]

- Works of art are products of personal progress and understanding.
- Products of art criticism are biased, static viewpoints. They are not timeless as art.

- Personal progress only produces art after a seemingly inordinate length of time.

- Works by Richard Dehmel are an example of incomplete art, which comes from incomplete views and is still good in some ways.
