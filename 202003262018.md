title: Your job will always be a grind
---

Rilke addresses Kappus' misgivings about life as an officer in Letter Six.

- Every job is full of responsibilities that we dread, patterns of action that are 'just how it is done', or modes of thinking that seem contradictory to how we view ourselves.
- Every job is full of individuals in quiet misery.
- The average job will never be broad enough, provide enough freedom, to be capital-M Meaningful.
- This extends to any straightforward interaction with society; it will feel narrow and cramped.
- Only our thoughts and feelings and Nature that we confront while in solitude will be enough.
