title: Drowsy Driving and Risk Behaviors
---

- Some reports suggest drowsy driving as a factor in about 1 of 4 vehicle crashes in the US per annum.

- The *Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)* is a yearly survey administered by state health departments. For the 2011 and 2021 years, the BRFSS included an optional module on sleep for 10 states and Puerto Rico.

Respondents were asked whether they had 'ever nodded off or fallen asleep, even just for a brief moment, while driving?' in the past 30 days. 4% of 92,102 respondents reported falling asleep.
