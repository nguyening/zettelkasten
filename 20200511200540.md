title: Defenses against feelings
---

People deal with threatening feelings with behavioral defenses or distractions.
Take for example an 'angry person' that frequently insults or interrupts others, or has very few close friends. This behavior isolates them from other people, which can limit the risk of encountering tough feelings that come with intimacy.

By comparing your pain or suffering to other suffering, your comparison diminishes yours or someone else's pain. Diminishing pain necessarily does not eliminate your feelings towards it. To change your pain is to change your relation to it, so accepting and integrating it into your life is the only way to eliminate it.
