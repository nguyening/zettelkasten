title: Low-pass filtering on PID control
---

In most situations, noise is relatively low amplitude compared to signal. Additionally, the measured signals are typically high amplitude at lower frequencies (the error that we care about is infrequent). A low-pass filter is straightforwardly applied, allowing low-frequency information (some noise and high amplitude error) to be input into a derivative controller.
