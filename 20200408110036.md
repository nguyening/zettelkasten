title: Token Bucket Filter on a packet network
---

The *Token Bucket Filter* models a network where participants can describe the traffic that they expect to generate/support.

RFC 2215 specifies several parameters as TOKEN_BUCKET_TSPEC to describe the model:
    - b, token bucket capacity (units)
    - r, token generation rate (units/time)
    - P, peak rate (units/time)
    - M, max discrete workload size (units)
    - m, min size, i.e. round up to this size for discrete workloads (units)

Consider a network trafficking packets between nodes. Each node can be described as a token bucket on parameters *{b, r}*, where b is in bits and r is in bits-per-second.

- The token bucket cannot hold more than b tokens.
- Assume that packets have random sizes and that a node cannot transmit partial packets.
  This implies that a node cannot transmit a packet if there are not enough bucket tokens to account for the packet bit size. Such packets will be held in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue until the number of tokens is greater-than-or-equal-to the packet bit size.
- For packets the time spent waiting in the FIFO queue is called the *queuing delay*.
    - Take *Q* to be the bit capacity of the FIFO queue.
      The worst-case queuing delay is the time for the last packet in the queue to be transmitted, i.e. *Q/r*.
- A node's FIFO queue can be bounded in capacity. When the queue is full, packets are dropped.
  We can characterize this with a measure called the *cut-off rate*, the percentage of packets dropped due to lack of tokens and insufficient capacity in the FIFO queue.

- [A.K Parekh et al] prove that no packets will be dropped and the worst-case queuing delay is guaranteed to be the time that it takes to fill an empty bucket, if a network
    - can support a transmission rate _at least as fast as_ the token generation rate
    - can handle a burst, which is equal to the bucket capacity, by buffering bits
