title: Reckoning with emotions in solitude
---

Rilke addresses Kappus' loneliness over Christmastime in Letter Six.

- In times when we do not comprehend our own emotions, we are also personally alone. We own the lack of understanding.
- We can reckon with our emotions only in solitude.
- Most people would prefer to interact with or think about other people over being in solitude.
