Sleep Strategies Seminar w/ Dr. Vora

Insomnia is due to environmental factors under our control

Light
    Circadian rhythm is cued by light

    melatonin is heavily sensitive to blue spectrum light
        Use bright light during the day: open blinds, get outside, 10K lux
            Mimic the environment that your body is receptive to 
        Avoid bright light after sunset
            Dimmer switch, F.lux, phone, amber glasses
            orange LED night lights or candles can help minimize disruptions from going to the bathroom
        Get the phone out of the bedroom
            Seeds our unconscious with uneasy thoughts
            Like taking a shot of espresso at bedtime
            The endless scroll endlessly stimulates
        Get a real alarm clock for your bedroom
            Use two alarms: one for 10-15m prior, and one for non-negotiable alarms
            Snoozing does not get you good quality sleep, and neither do you get your morning
            Chronic snoozing is problematic

Physiology
    The more that you can set your body up, the easier it will be

    Blood sugar crashes during the day cause hungry and emotions, h'anger
        Middle insomnia, waking up throughout the night, could be from a blood sugar crash
        Cortisol + adrenaline is secreted during a crash which causes the liver to secrete glucose
        More protein and healthy fats, less sugar and alcohol
        Take a spoonful of almond butter before bed, or to combat middle insomnia

    Caffeine is a drug that promotes wakefulness, promotes a stress response
        Caffeine has a long half-life (5-7h)
        If you love the ritual do decaf
        Stop by 12pm, push it earlier, reduce overall caffeine

    Alcohol
        Disrupts sleep architecture, which we define as stages of sleep that build upon each deeper stage.
        Alcohol can shunt your brain from deeper stages.

    Magnesium
        Most people are deficient are in it because our food is deficient, and because soil is deficient in it.
        magnesium glycinate (400-800mg) at bedtime, loose stool is a sign of too much

    Melatonin
        It is not sleep inducing, but tells your body the time of day, 'circadian-informing'.
        This is useful for jet-lag
        Promote endogenous (your own internal) melatonin production

Bedtime
    "3 hours after sunset" is optimal from anthropological studies
    Recognize your tired signs, rubbing your eyes or yawning
    Overtired is when you miss your natural time to sleep and your body secreting cortisol, 'why didnt i sleep when i was tired, there must be stress'
    Recognize your '2nd wind', your want to suddenly start to clean the house, tossing and turning

Bedroom

    Colder than your think, 65F
        We are adapted to sleeping as the temperature drops
        The idea is not to be shivering, you are warm in a blanket
        Weighted blankets help with anxiety, but also better sleep

    Dark
        Blackout shades, eye mask, but don't let your eyes see any light in the middle of the night
        Nursing a kid in the middle of the night, and the light from your phone

    Quiet
        Partner that snores, cat that scratches, garbage truck -- just get a white noise machine
        A little change rather than smooth white noise causes the brain to have to triage whether or not it is a tiger sound

How much sleep
    It is a bell curve, but 95% need 7-9. The majority of the room gets 6h of sleep.
    Like a shoe size, you are walking around with incorrectly sized shoes. This is a genetic factor.

Routine
    Spend more time unplugged
    Set a night alarm
    Stop using electronics by 9pm

Ideal wind down schedule
    - 9pm shut down electronics
    - 930 take a bath
    - 10 reading in bed with amber glasses
    - 1015 lights out
    - 4-7-8 breath as needed
      Inhale 4count, hold for 7count, out for 8count

Write down a list of whats on your mind. Your brain is trying to juggle things but you can outside to a piece of paper.

Bruxism (teeth grinding), medication related or stress
    3minutes of mindful meditation
    Change the tone of your nervous system
    Acupunctune has some evidence basis 
    Relationship between the jaw and the hips
    Night guard

- Nightmares/disturbing dreams
  Conscious choices about what you invite before bed.
