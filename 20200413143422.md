title: Catholicism as a set of consistent questions

- Neither the Gospels nor Catholic teaching directly address every possible situation.
- Catholicism forms a set of consistent questions, with a variety of personal answers that develop over time.
- Your understanding of the Gospels can change because your circumstances change.
