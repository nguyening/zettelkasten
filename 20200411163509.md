title: Relativism is incompatible with wisdom
---

- Wisdom is the ability to discern truth.
- Relativism is the theory that truth is not a homogenous quality. Truths are idiosyncractic and can be contradictory.
  It follows that Morality cannot be imposed on anyone by another. Morals cannot be true in any shared way.
