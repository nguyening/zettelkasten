title: On finding and losing God
---

Rilke asks if one can lose belief in a God in Letter Six.

- Faith is a heavy burden for grown men. When the men grow old, the weight of faith crushes them.
- How can one lose faith when it is so hard-fought?
- It might be more true to say that children who lose their faith in adulthood never posssessed it.
- If you realize a suspicion that Christ or Muhammad or Buddha were confused, or that God never really existed at all, why search for faith and belief in things like that?
- Consider how and why our forebearers set out on the project of God long ago, and consider yourself another forebear in this project whose fruits you will never live to see.
