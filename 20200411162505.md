title: The prayer process
---

- The prayer process is is akin to a daily examination of conscience, which should be a positive experience.
- The examination improves our ability to experience life by increasing our conscious-ness, an honest awareness of all things internal and external.
  The examination identifies the most urgent things in our lives, which should be virtues like compassion, generosity, humility, and fortitude.

The prayer process is a series of topics to have in a conversation with God. You visit the topics in sequence in your daily practice of prayer.

1. Thanks
2. Missing-the-mark
3. Significant moments
4. Forgiveness
5. Divine inspiration
6. Others

The practice ends with reciting the Lord's Prayer.
