title: The Problem of Evil, in scale
---

Consider the view that Evil simply exists in our world. You cannot prevent Evil. If one bad person can purchase a gun, then all every bad person can purchase a gun. If one improverished person is given a job, then all improverished people will be given a job. Three major issues of our time, dying of preventible illness, school shootings, and back-alley abortions, are like the problem of Mondays to office workers.

In this view morality can only communicate how we can identify Evil, rather than combat it. By distinguishing values between people, morality creates an in-group and out-group. Out-groups are persecuted.
In this view the only choice between two evils is refusal, preserving integrity and never compromising morals.

Contrast this view with that of Evil manifesting from proportion and populations. Systems of Evil manifest from populations where some succeed in committing Evil and some fail. In this view choosing to support the lesser of two evils necessarily mitigates evil.
