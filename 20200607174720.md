title: What follows from Meritocracy
---

- It follows that a world in which the success is attributed to those with merit, failure is attributed to those without. They are responsible for their failure.
- Meritocratic societies are those in which all have the opportunity to succeed based on their own merits, regardless of background.
    An element of justice in the distribution of rewards, and of poverty
    Low status is deserved
    - Succeeding in spite of lack of connections contrast with noblemen of older times who simply received property.
- Unfortunate, the target of charity for the paternally minded rich 
- Failures, target of contempt in the eyes of self-made individuals
- The social hierarchy rigorously reflects the qualities of the members on every rung of the ladder
    The conditions already exist for good people to succeed,

- Luck has a theoretical role in shaping lives, but winners make their own luck
- We are all responsible for everything
- THe merit of an individual is complex, more than your occupation or how much money you earn
- Ordinary humans can be good judges of merit
- No one gets exactly what they deserve: good or bad
- Life is random
- What someone earns and what they are like as humans
