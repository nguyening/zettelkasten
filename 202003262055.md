title: Conventions are answers given by other people
---

From Rilke's Letter Seven,

- Conventions are solutions that we receive from other people.
- In order to be applicable to many, conventions are characteristically *easy*.
- Any action that does not come from within yourself, found in solitude, is just convention.
- Acting according to convention leads to disappointment. You will look for a personal solution, an answer that makes things right according to you.
- But, if you have not taken the time to consider the boundaries of yourself (particularly in solitude), you will only arrive at other conventions.
