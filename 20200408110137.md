title: Token bucket adaptation to measured delay and traffic
---

T.-Y., et al. devise a protocol for tuning a token bucket from two periodic measurements. First they define

- the base unit in packet transmission time i.e. seconds
- an averaging *span* of _S_ seconds
- a *block* of _n_ spans, or _n * S_ seconds

Typically the two measurements are updated at the boundary of two blocks:

- Block estimated queueing delay
Within a block, measure the queuing delay for every packet transmitted. Store the maximum as the estimated delay.

- Block aggregate traffic rate
1. For each span within a block, measure the average bit rate. This is calculated from the number of packets sent during the span, divided by the duration of the span (_S_ seconds).
   Store the average bit rate as a sample _Si_.
2. At the end of a block (_n_ spans), take the maximum of the _n_ samples.
   Store the maximum as the aggregate traffic rate.

There are two scenarios when the measurements are updated during a block:
- When a new flow is added during a measurement block.
  Add the [worst-case queueing delay (1)](#token-bucket) of the new flow to the estimated delay.

- When a sampled average bit rate is greater than the current estimated traffic rate.
  Consider that the estimate is a maximum over averages. To be conservative you should use a larger value than the one sampled.
  T.-Y. Tan et al. use the sampled value, while S. Jamin et al. double the sampled value.

## The protocol
Consider a source and destination nodes, and recall that token buckets are defined with by [capacity _b_, and token generation rate _r_ (1)](#token-bucket).

The source node is configured with four parameters:
- L, threshold [the cut-off rate (1)](#token-bucket)
- D, threshold queuing delay
- P, [peak bit rate (1)](#token-bucket)
- M, [the max packet size (1)](#token-bucket)

1. The source node initializes its token bucket with generation rate as P and initial token size as M.
2. The source node sends an admission request packet to the destination (or an intermediate node) with r, b, L, and D.
3. The destination node considers if the new flow without [exceeding allocated bandwidth capacity or violating existing delay guarantees for other flows (2)](#qos-conditions)
   The destination will send an 'accept' packet to the source if both conditions are satisfied.
   The destination will send a 'reject' packet to the source otherwise.

   The admission request is accepted if every node along the path from source to destination accepts.
4. The source node begins sending packets, while monitoring the cut-off rate.
5. Whenever the observed cut-off rate exceeds L, or there has been no packet loss for a period of time, the source node will create a new admission request packet.
   This packet will update [r and b to optimal values (3)](#optimal).
   In the event that this new request is rejected, the source node will continue with its previous parameters.
