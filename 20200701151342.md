title: Clamping and conditional integration
---

Clamping, also called conditional integration, disables the integral controller by setting the error term to 0.

A PID controller acts upon an actuator, which inputs into the controlled system (process). Actuators have limits, e.g. physical limits of propeller speed for a drone. We can clamp accounting for these limits.

The decision to clamp considers two conditions:
- the command to the actuator is 'saturating', hits some limit
- the sign of the error (+/-) matches the sign of the controller output

If the actuator is in a saturating state and the controller is attempting to make it worse (make negative error more negative, vice-versa), then we decide to clamp.
In the drone example, the integral controller will be clamped at some intermediate point. When the error sign-changes to negative, the error input to the integral will be restored and the accumulated error will decrease, decreasing the propeller speed and limiting overshoot.
