- Humor is temporally- and culturally-bound. This dovetails into theories for why modern readers may not recognize the humor within the Gospels.
- Additionally, the modern believer's almost rote recall of these stories affects the novelty of the humor.

- Humor is a tool for humility
    - Telling jokes about yourself is a way of cutting yourself down
    - It is essential to laugh at ourselves
    - Reminder at the poverty of our spirit; we are all human

- Humor can shock listeners into recognizing reality
    - Humor communicates truth in a way an argument does not
    - The story about the man with the cheese sandwiches
        "I'm the one who makes the cheese sandwiches"
    - Jesus' use of parables and stories

- Humor speaks truth to power, exposing and defusing the arrogance of religious authorities

- Humor shows Christian courage
    - St Thomas Moore on way to his executioner, "I pray thee help me on the way up; I will take care of the way down"

- Humor depends our relationship with God
    - Prayer can be thought as a personal relationship: when you compare your relationship to a friend, it can clarify things.
    One-on-one time, honesty, it can go through rocky times or infatuation, it requires silence
    - Every relationship could use some humor: can you let God take delight in you?
    Can you imagine: God likes you.
    Can you imagine the surprising, or things that cut you down to size, signs that He is being playful.

- Humor welcomes.
    - Hospitality, holiness, humor - story of Isaac (which means 'he laughs'), where Abraham and Sarah laugh at the idea of bearing a child
    - Jesuit indifference - being able to pick between working at a US Jesuit school or in Africa at a refuge

- Humor gives us a break, so that we can heal.
    - It may help to lighten a painful situation.
    - We release endorphins, we relax.

- Humor can open our minds.
    - Psychologists say that we hear better when we relax. (fight-vs-flight)

- Humor is fun.
    - Fun is a foretaste of heaven.
    St. Ignatius would dance a jig when his brothers were down.
