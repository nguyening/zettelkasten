title: Guarantee network QoS with admission control
---

- You cannot guarantee Quality-of-Service without checking if adding new data flows will violate existing flows in a network.
- The approach in T.-Y. Tan, et al. describes three conditions that all new network flows must meet:

    1. The total bandwidth allocated after admitting the new flow will not exceed some proportion of system capacity.
    2. Admitting the new flow will not excessively impact the delay of flows of the same priority level.
    3. Admitting the new flow will not excessively impact the delay of flows of lower priority levels.
