title: Proactivity in friendship

We can attribute proactivity as a quality of friendships. One might say that to contact a friend when they come to mind is proactive. Proactive friends nurture conditions that encourage communication.
Conversely we can think of reactive friends as primarily responding to communication.

Spontaneity is not a requirement for proactivity; the essence is fostering communication, which one can 'schedule'.
