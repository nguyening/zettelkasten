title: Unit test your performance harness

# Sanity-checking
- Build in correctness checks (e.g. invariants, assumptions) outside of timing portions in the test. If they can be made lightweight, perform these checks within the test.

# Easy cases first
- The complexity and dynamic nature of production environments (memory page size, hyperthreading, power management features) can have a larger impact on performance than algorithmic differences.
- Simple cases are probably not comparable to a production workload, but can be used as 'unit tests' to check expectations.
  For example, if a parallel version does not scale in the predicted way when compared to a serial algorithm, it will be quicker to identify the reason for the unexpected results in this easier case.

  Does doubling the duration of the test cause the results to change?
