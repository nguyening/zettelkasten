title: Feedback control with PID
---

Consider a system with an output that we want to control. How do we control an input for a desired output?
The method of feedback control uses the observed output of a system compared to the desired output.

The difference between observed and desired outputs is called the error term. Getting the error term to zero is the goal.
A controller is a component for translating an error term into inputs.

A proportional controller scales error by a factor.
One system is you are trying to reach the midpoint of a field. The error is your distance to the midpoint, and the proportional controller scales this distance to calculate your walking speed.

Proportional controllers have trouble with steady-state error.
One system is a drone trying to reach a specific height. The error is the vertical distance of the drone to the top, and the proportional controller scales the distance to calculate a propeller speed. At a certain propeller speed, the drone hovers. A too-low scaling factor will cause the drone to hover before we reaching our desired height. We must continue to increase the factor to minimize the steady-state error. No matter how high this factor becomes, the error will never be 0.

An integral controller keeps a running total of error. Positive error causes positive outputs, and vice-versa with negative.
The drone system will have non-zero error while in an error steady-state. This error accumulates which entails the integral controller output increases the propeller speed.

A control system with a proportional-integral controller can overshoot desired output depending on how they have been tuned.
A derivative controller measures the error rate-of-change.
In the drone system, a derivative controller will reduce the propeller speed depending on how quickly the error decreases.

A PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller uses error information from the past (integral), present (proportional), and future (derivative). Each controller's influence on the output is weighted by the modeler.
