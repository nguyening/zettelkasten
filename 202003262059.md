title: Love requires knowing Self
---

- We imagine Love as a giving-over-to and merging-of two individuals.
- Love can only manifest like this with discrete individuals. You have marked off the boundaries and defined yourself.
- Knowing yourself is having lived the questions, and young people have not lived enough to know Love.
