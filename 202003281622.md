Peeling the eggshells from the soft-boiled eggs will be steep quicker.

Eggs will keep as long as typical soft-boiled eggs. The marinade *does not* preserve them.

**Aromatics**
- Star anise
- Cinnamon stick
- Clove
- Five spice powder
- Bay leaf
- Sichuan peppercorn
- Dried chile pepper

- 8 eggs
- Water, enough to cover eggs
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- Black tea leaves
- Rock sugar to taste
  (or, cane sugar)

In one pot,
1. Soft-boil the eggs.
2. When cool enough to handle, crack the eggshells throughout with the back of a spoon.

In another pot,
3. Add all aromatics to a pot and bring water to a boil.
4. Steep tea leaves for 10 minutes.
5. Cool the liquid to room temperature.
6. Steep the eggs in the refrigerator overnight to 48 hours.
