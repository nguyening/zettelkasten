title: Parents instill rejecting feelings inadvertently 
---

When a parent says, "Don't be so sensitive" to a child that says "I'm angry." Or when a parent distracts a child with a balloon when they say that they are sad. Or when the parent mocks the child for being afraid. This can confuse children when they are identifying their feelings.
