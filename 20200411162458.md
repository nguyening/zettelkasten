title: Characteristics of engaged Catholics
---

- Engaged Catholics are those working towards the goal of the Church. We can observe them in participation within parishes.
- The Pareto (or 80/20) principle states that 80% of results come from 20% of actors.
  In financial giving and volunteering, American Catholic parishes do not follow this principle. 80% of contributions come from about 7% of registered parishioners.

- These four signs are concise, characteristic attitudes and behaviors that enable individuals to approach them idiosyncratically, and incrementally in scale.
  They are also general enough to apply as a model for [further spiritual development](20200413143422.md).

### Structured, routine prayer
- [The prayer process](20200411162505.md) is an example of structuring prayer.
- Prayer can be structured around devotional material, like the Gospels.
- Routine prayer is done at the same time, and in the same way each day.
- It is important to not only set aside time, but specific [places for silence](20200413185650.md).

### Routine study of the faith
- This study engages the perspective of the Church across many situations, which [distances our questions from personal biases](20200413143422.md).

### Generosity in all areas
- Generosity is how you dispense of what is at your disposal: time, talent, and treasure.
- To sustain generosity, you must first appreciate the things at your disposal. Engaged Catholics do not receive more of anything to dispense, but tend to be more grateful.
- To broaden the scope of generosity, you must actively seek out opportunities to be generous.
- The extent of your generosity is best measured by what is left to yourself.

### Inspire spiritual growth in others
- One should help others develop prayer lives.
- Prayer can be personal and communal. In communal prayer like the Mass, a community shares its faith and prayer lives. This is a recognition that living alone is deeply unsatisfactory, and living with God involves seeking grace in his community.
