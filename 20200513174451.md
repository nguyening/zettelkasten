title: Therapeutic self-narrative
---

The information that a patient relates to therapist is biased, incomplete.
Therapists inspect personal narratives. They navigate the narratives like an editor: examining themes, identifying critical foci.
A therapist in dialogue brings up points of curiosity. "Why does my partner do this?" Someone that is not self-curious cannot benefit from identifying these points.
    We can hope to find ways to let people know that they have hurt or wronged us. We can hope that these people will in turn become the people that we want or need them to be. We can hope that therapy can unlock this for us, but this is not common. Therapy does not change the people in your life according to your desires. Therapy can help you realize and accept personal responsibility.
Therapy is an opportunity for patients to continue their behavior in a controlled environment. The therapist directs the patient to reflect on the problem in light of themselves making it highly idiosyncratic, as it must be tailored not just for the problem but individual at hand and eliminates distractions like prohibiting cell phone use.
