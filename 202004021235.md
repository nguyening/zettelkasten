title: Performance beyond timing
---

Apart from timing or operational throughput there are many ways to understand resource usage for an algorithm:
  - count of instructions executed
  - count of memory reads
  - count of floating point instructions
  - count of exceptions/traps
  - TLB miss rate
  - miss rate for a cache level

- Compare performance results between different configurations:
  1. test with performance counters disabled
     This test is useful to confirm insignificant overhead from performance measurement.
  2. test with performance counters
  3. test with memory performance
