title: Origin of good art
---

In Letter One, Rilke responds to Mr. Kappus' request for feedback. Rilke states plainly that all good art originates from its creator.

- The inner genesis entails that no one can provide advice for creating good art.
- Turn to your daily life; all of it, and across time.
- Avoid themes with readily great examples. These are more difficult to produce novel, original ideas.
